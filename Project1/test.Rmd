## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(openintro)
data("fastfood", package='openintro')
library(ggplot2)

combined_data <- rbind(mcdonalds, dairy_queen)


ggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = restaurant, y = cal_fat, fill = restaurant)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Calories from Fat",
       x = "Restaurant",
       y = "Calories from Fat") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("dairy_queen" = "blue", "mcdonalds" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#ggplot(data = mcdonalds, aes(x=restaurant, y=cal_fat, fill=restaurant)) +
  #geom_boxplot() +
  #labs(title="Distribution of Calories from Fat",
       #x="Restaurant",
       #y="Calories from Fat") +
  #scale_fill_manual(values=c("mcdonalds"="blue", "dairy_queen"="red")) +
  #theme_minimal()
mcd_dq <- fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant == "Mcdonalds"| restaurant == "Dairy Queen")

ggplot(data = mcd_dq, aes(x = cal_fat, color = restaurant)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Fat Calories in Mcdonalds") +
  xlab("Calories from Fat") + ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1500, by = 100)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.005, by = 0.0005))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Assuming you have already loaded the necessary libraries and data

# Combine the two datasets and add a new column for the source
dairy_queen$Source <- "Dairy Queen"
mcdonalds$Source <- "McDonald's"
combined_data <- rbind(dairy_queen, mcdonalds)

# Create the combined histogram using facet_wrap
library(ggplot2)
(ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = cal_fat)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Fat Calories in Fast Food Chains") +
  xlab("Calories from Fat") + ylab("Density") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1500, by = 100)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.005, by = 0.0005)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Source, ncol = 2)  # Arrange plots side by side

```
