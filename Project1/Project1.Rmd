This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
```{r}
#chesstxt <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shayaeng/Data607/main/Project1/chess.txt")
chess_raw <- readLines("chess.txt")

chess_filtered <- c()

#First, let's get rid of those '---' lines
for (line in chess_raw) {
  if (!grepl("^-+$", line)) {
    chess_filtered <- c(chess_filtered, line)
  }
}

#Now we'll remove the first two lines
chess_filtered <- chess_filtered[-(1:2)]

#Next, let's combine each of the two lines per record
chess_combined <- c()
for (i in seq(1, length(chess_filtered), by = 2)) {
  bottom_part <- chess_filtered[i]
  top_part <- chess_filtered[i + 1]
  combined_line <- paste(bottom_part, top_part)
  chess_combined <- c(chess_combined, combined_line)
}
  
#for (line in chess_combined) {
# print(line)
#}

#split the lines by their records
chess_split <- c()
for (line in chess_combined) {
  split_line <- strsplit(line, split = '\\|')
  trimmed_line <- lapply(split_line, str_trim)
  chess_split <- c(chess_split, trimmed_line)
}

#convert to data frame
chess_df <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, chess_split))
```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
