## Assignment Prompt

1.  Perform a Scenario Design analysis as described below.
     Consider whether it makes sense for your selected recommender system to perform scenario design twice, once for the organization (e.g. Amazon.com) and once for the organization's customers.

2.  Attempt to reverse engineer what you can about the site, from the site interface and any available information that you can find on the Internet or elsewhere.

3.  Include specific recommendations about how to improve the site's recommendation capabilities going forward. 

## Spotify's Recommender System

The purpose of this report is to conduct a Scenario Design analysis of Spotify's recommender system, particularly, the music segment as opposed to podcasts.
Spotify, employs a sophisticated recommendation engine to enhance user experience and engagement.
This analysis aims to understand the current system, identify stakeholders, and propose recommendations for both the organization (Spotify) and its customers (users).

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to recommend content to users.
There are a variety of techniques different systems can utilize.
Spotify's recommender system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and machine learning algorithms.
Collaborative filtering entails using information gleaned from other users to recommend content to the user, such as other songs liked by users who share some liked songs with the user.
Content-based filtering entails analyzing the user's liked content and finding other similar content on the platform.
This analysis involves artist-sourced metadata, listening to the 'feel' of the music (slow, fast etc.) and using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the text of the song.

Spotify's primary business goals related to the recommender system include improving user satisfaction, increasing user engagement, and obtaining and retaining paid subscribers.
The recommender system plays a crucial role in delivering personalized content to users.

There are multiple parties invested in Spotify's recommender system.
First and most obviously are the listeners.
The act of listening to music has shifted from individuals meticulously selecting a particular album or song for enjoyment to a more convenient experience of choosing a playlist and finding satisfaction in the majority of the newly discovered songs.
In order to acheive that, a good recommender system is necessary.
Aside from the listeners, the music creators have an interest in the systems too.
The creators get paid based on the amount of listens their content gets; a system that introduces their music to potential fans benefits them as well.

**Reverse Engineering:**

Exploring the Spotify app interface reveals how recommendations are presented to users, including recommending similar artists, personalized playlists, radio stations, and the popular "Discover" feature.
Understanding the user experience is vital for proposing improvements.

Upon creating a new account, Spotify prompts the user for some favorite artists and songs.
The app also makes it easy to 'like' a song.
Both of these features help Spotify create the tailored recommendations.

**Recommendations:**

**For Spotify (Organization)**:

*Algorithmic Improvements:*

-   Genre and Mood Enhancement: suggest improvements to content-based filtering by refining the understanding of music genres, moods, and contextual factors.

-   User Engagement Features: Propose introducing features that encourage user engagement, such as personalized playlists for special occasions or collaborative playlists with friends.

-   Feedback Mechanism: Implement a direct and user-friendly feedback mechanism, enabling users to provide explicit feedback on individual songs or playlists.

**For Spotify Users (Customers):**

-   Encourage users to provide more detailed preferences, including favorite genres, artists, and moods.
    Allow customization of profiles to reflect changes in music taste.

-   Artists should clearly label all the metadata of their content, such as the genre and label of the song.

In conclusion, this Scenario Design analysis of Spotify's recommender system provides valuable insights for both the organization and its users.
By implementing the recommended improvements, Spotify can enhance user satisfaction, increase engagement, and maintain its position as a leading music streaming platform.
Regular iterations based on user feedback and evolving listening patterns will be key to the ongoing success of the recommender system.
