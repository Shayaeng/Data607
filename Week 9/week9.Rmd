## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
library(httr2)
library(jsonlite)
library(dotenv)
```

```{r}
api_key <- "2jwArsQmT9WAKyUGCEHV14za7zDSg24S"

#api_url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/emailed/7.json"
api_url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/1.json"

response <- GET(api_url, query = list(api_key = api_key))
```

```{r}
if (http_status(test)$status == 200) {
  # Parse the JSON content
  json_content <- content(response, "text")
  
  # Convert JSON to a data frame
  dataframe <- fromJSON(json_content, flatten = TRUE)
  
  # Print or manipulate the data as needed
  print(dataframe)
} else {
  # Print an error message if the request was not successful
  print("Error fetching data from the API.")
}
```
```{r}
api <- request(r"(https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/)") # We initialize a request object to our main API path
req <- api %>%
  req_url_path_append("emailed/7.json.json") %>% # This is the API pah we want to take to get bestsellers lists
  req_url_query(`list` = "Combined Print and E-Book Nonfiction", `api-key` = key_get("APIKeys","NYtimes")) # We get the specific type of list we want and authenticate within the request query
resp <- req %>%
  req_perform()
resp$status_code
```
```{r}
#usa_data <- fromJSON("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/us.json?api-key=VhHaGQL7qb0A4ulIICuMg2M5JKNWijv5")
#test <- fromJSON("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/{period}.json?api-key=2jwArsQmT9WAKyUGCEHV14za7zDSg24S")
api_key <- "2jwArsQmT9WAKyUGCEHV14za7zDSg24S"
period <- 7  # Replace with the desired period

url <- sprintf("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/viewed/%d.json?api-key=%s", period, api_key)

test <- fromJSON(url)

dataframe <- as.data.frame(test)
```
